# FME Python Utilities

A collection of Python scripts that can be used as standalone utilities or as custom transformers within FME (Feature Manipulation Engine). These tools enhance FME's capabilities by providing additional functionality for workflow automation, process monitoring, and data transformation.

This repository includes utilities for monitoring system processes, coordinating asynchronous workspaces, and other specialized operations that extend FME's native capabilities. Each script is designed to be easily integrated into FME workspaces while maintaining flexibility for standalone Python usage.

The primary focus is on providing practical solutions for common FME workflow challenges, with emphasis on robustness, configurability, and clear documentation. These tools are particularly valuable for FME power users who need to coordinate complex processing tasks or integrate with external systems.
